# TweetSentimentExtractionDecisionMaking
This is my effort extract sentiments from tweets to drive decision making using Tweepy & TextBlob. The Sentiment Extraction in the attached notebook focuses on two particular usecases and how sentiment extraction can be used in directing adverts towards user.

1st Use Case:

ESPN and Netflix recently collaborated to create the sport documentary "The Last Dance" to huge critical acclaim and commercial success.I have extracted recent tweets about the show and extracted the sentiments behind these tweets.Based on these extracted sentiments one can target users for adverts related to Last Dance or other related sports documentary shows and they would be more likely to click on these adverts.

2nd Use Case:

Disney+ not long ago and released a Star Wars spin off web series by the name of Mandalorian and it quickly gained a huge popularity.I extracted tweets related to this show and extracted the sentiments behind them.The users which tweeted with positive sentiments about this show are more likely to follow up on a advert featuring another science fiction shows from Disney+.


Please Note: I have included fake tokens in the notebook instead of own for obvious reasons. Please replace them with yours when working with this notebook.
